          I love to understand the way things work—everything, from simple
          kitchen gadgets to complex calculus equations. Understanding helps
          equip me to create. And <strong>I <em>love</em> to create.</strong>

          When I'm not clickin' away at my keyboard, you'll find me playing
          music, going for walks, or cooking.

          I work remotely as a software engineer at <strong>Amazon</strong> on the Modeling &
          Optimization team.
