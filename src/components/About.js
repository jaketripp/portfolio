                <p>I love to understand the way things work. Everything - from simple kitchen gadgets to complex calculus equations. Understanding helps equip me to create. And <strong>I <em>love</em> to create.</strong></p>
                <p>My passion is making <strong>responsive, mobile-first web applications and websites.</strong></p>
